# Sample-website
This is the very first website I have ever coded using HTML and CSS. 
With this site's blue and green color scheme, I aimed to convey a sense of natural cleanliness. 
All of my professional recognitions and titles come complete with direct links to my Gmail, Github, and LinkedIn profiles.
